Global Health Monitor is a Client-Server App that allows you to montior the health attrtibutes of computers.

The deployed machines will run the standalone form application with an internet connection.

The IIS Server will host the Server-side application to receive updates from deployed machines.
This server also has a default page set up to view the update data in text form (Sorry, no fancy UI yet).

An SQL database is required for persistence and will hold all updates from deployed clients.
